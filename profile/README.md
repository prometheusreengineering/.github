*prometheus - a god best known for defying the Olympian gods by taking fire from them and giving it to humanity in the form of technology, knowledge and, more generally, civilization.*

## About Us
Prometheus is a collective of people driven by an unyielding passion for reverse engineering and the dissemination of knowledge. While we do not claim to be experts in the field, our collective enthusiasm and commitment enable us to navigate and surmount the numerous roadblocks imposed by modern societal constructs, such as paywalls and restricted access to information.

## Support Our Mission
Prometheus operates under the principle that knowledge should be universally accessible. To this end, we develop and maintain our projects entirely free of charge, ensuring that everyone, regardless of financial status, can benefit from our work.

However, sustaining such an endeavor requires resources. If you have the financial means and wish to support our mission, your donation would be immensely appreciated and would directly contribute to the continuation and growth of our initiatives.

Every contribution, no matter the size, helps us to keep the fire burning and the projects alive.
